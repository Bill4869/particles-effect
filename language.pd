Fortran%:%Created in the 1950s, Fortran is designed for high-performance scientific and engineering computing.
Go%:%Created by Google, Go has built-in support for programs that need to exchange information while running concurrently on different computers.
Haskell%:%Designed for applications where reliability is important.
Java%:%Java can reduce costs, drive innovation, and improve application services as the programming language of choice for IoT, enterprise architecture, and cloud computing.
JavaScript%:%JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, programming language with first-class functions.
Lua%:%A scripting language often used to make other applications programmable, especially in the animation and gaming domains.
Matlab%:%A scripting language for MathWorks' Matlab computing environment, Matlab is designed for numerical computing tasks, such as engineering or scientific simulations.
Node.js%:%Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
Objective-C%:%Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language used by the Apple operating system.
Perl%:%Perl 5 is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over 29 years of development. More about why we love Perl...

Python%:%Python is powerful... and fast; plays well with others;runs everywhere; is friendly & easy to learn;
R%:%Designed for programming statistical analysis and data-mining applications.
Ruby%:%A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.
Rust%:%Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.
Scala%:%Have the best of both worlds. Construct elegant class hierarchies for maximum code reuse and extensibility, implement their behavior using higher-order functions. Or anything in-between.
Shell%:%A catchall term for a number of frameworks that allow scripting of operating system command-line instructions.
SQL%:%Structured Query Language (SQL) is a special-purpose language for managing data in relational database management systems.
Swift%:%Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and Swift includes modern features developers love. Swift code is safe by design, yet also produces software that runs lightning-fast.
TypeScript%:%TypeDcript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. Any browser. Any host. Any OS. Open source.
Visual Basic%:%Visual Basic is engineered for productively building type-safe and object-oriented applications. Visual Basic enables developers to target Windows, Web, and mobile devices. As with all languages targeting the Microsoft .NET Framework, programs written in Visual Basic benefit from security and language interoperability.
